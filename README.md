# Platform
The Whole idea is to create a Coding platform similar to Codechef or HackerRank or
Leetcode. The platform will consist of Developer IDE supporting 10 languages(beta)
surmounting to more later. It will consist Login Forum (Free) for Developer community.
Question/Problem posts and Coding challenges. We will also be providing Freelance Project
Bounties. The Platform will be Like a Bar for Coding Bounty Hunters. You Play, Practice,
Hunt and Earn. With each challenges and Bounties users will earn real money along with
hunt points like breadkrumbs which will be redeemable for swags.
